# resize-photos-challenge

Given a Webservice endpoint that returns a JSON of ten photos, consume it and generate three different photo formats for each one, that must be small (320x240), medium (384x288) and large (640x480).

Finally, write a Webservice endpoint, which should use a non-relational database(MongoDB preferred) and list (in JSON format) all ten photos with their respective formats, providing their URLs.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.0.
